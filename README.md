# lisp-math
A math function-pack for lisp.

**Have you ever wanted a catalan number generator for your lisp?**<br/>
Well, this has that, and basically, everything but the kitchen sink!

Here's a few of the things in this pack:
<ul>
  <li>Combination calculators!</li>
  <li>Fibonacci creators!</li>
  <li>_p versions of every function that comes (fib -> fibp)!!!!</li>
 </ul>
 
 This is all open-source, so come and add your own!

 <sub>Awesome note: this comes with a <strong>create-p</strong> macro to create your own predicates!</sub>
